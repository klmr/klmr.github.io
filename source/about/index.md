    Hi. üëã My name is Konrad.

    I‚Äôm a senior research engineer and software developer at [PetaGene][].

    In my previous life I was a postdoctoral researcher in [Eric Miska‚Äôs
    group][eam] at the [University of Cambridge][] ([Gurdon Institute][]). My
    PhD was supervised by John Marioni at the [European Bioinformatics
    Institute][EBI] (<abbr>[EMBL][]</abbr>-<abbr>EBI</abbr>).

## Research

I do most of my research on genomics and the regulation of translation in
mammals through changes in <abbr>tRNA</abbr> abundance and codon usage. The
title of my [PhD thesis][] was *‚ÄúInvestigating the link between
<abbr>tRNA</abbr> and <abbr>mRNA</abbr> abundance in mammals‚Äù*.

Before that, I‚Äôve worked in algorithms and software development, in particular
implementing high-throughput sequencing read mapping tools, and creating
frameworks for the automatic parallelisation of high-performance code on
multicore architecture. I have also done work in cell regulatory networks.

## Open Source projects

Some of my most widely used projects are

* **[box][]**: A package for the [R programming language][R] that enables
    writing reusable, composable and modular R code

* **[minted][]**, a syntax highligher package for [LaTeX][] based on [Pygments][]

To see more of my contributions to Open Source projects, visit my  [GitHub
profile][GitHub].

## Teaching

I have, at various times, taught on the following subjects:

* High-throughput sequence analysis
* <abbr title="computer science">CS</abbr> 101 *&* <abbr title="computer science">CS</abbr> 102
* Algorithms in bioinformatics
* Database systems *&* <abbr>SQL</abbr>
* C++ ¬∑ <abbr>VB</abbr> ¬∑ Unix/Bash ¬∑ LaTeX ¬∑ R ¬∑ Git
* Basics of data compression

I‚Äôm also occasionally active on [Stack Overflow][], where I‚Äôm one of the 0.01%
most active contributors of all time, although in recent years I have massively
reduced my activity (for a brief moment in 2009 I was #1, but that turns out to
have been a miscalculation due to a bug in the Stack Overflow software).
